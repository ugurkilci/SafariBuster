# SafariBuster
Safari browser detection tool.

Google strongly recommends the .webp extension. So I made the pictures .webp. Then I saw that Apple blocked pictures with this extension in Safari. In short I'm caught between Google and Apple.

I developed this temporarily as I could not find the code that would display .webp images as .jpg when entered from Safari.

When entering with Safari, it suggests using Chrome or Firefox.

Don't forget to give stars.
